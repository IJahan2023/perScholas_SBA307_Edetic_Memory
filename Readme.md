PerScholas SBA 307: HTML and CSS 

This is an inspo from all the images I have collected from https://www.pexels.com. I have used most of the images from the website that pertain to Bangladesh. It's like a photo dump booth where you see nostalgic images that remind me how badly I need a vacation and run back to what I used to call “home”. 

I created this website on a fly but I had fun working on it in a short span of time. Please feel free to ask me any questions or if you have trouble opening files or images. Since they are stock images I am afraid they may break at any given point.

Thank you for visiting my Edetic Memory! 


Reflection 

Once you have completed your project, answer the following questions to help solidify your understanding of the process and its outcomes.
<a>What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?    

Truly sitting down with a pen and paper and completing a wire frame would have given me more structure and made execution easier to know I have completed all parts of the SBA requirements. 


<b>Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects? Nope, not really. 


<c>What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?
I would refactor my code and polished it a bit- if I had time. 

<d>Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.
